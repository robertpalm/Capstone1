<h1>About me</h1>

<h3>The professional me</h3>
<p>Over the years I've obtained two different educations and worked on 3 different Vocations.<br>
    I have been a Chef for almost 8 years during which I was constantly in direct contact with the customer, so it's safe to say that <br>
    I have plenty of experience in Customer Service and Interaction.<br>
    <br>
    For a short while I was also a Head Chef / Manager of a restaurant and that took my people skills and my fresh marketing knowledge to a new level. <br>
    But since I was aiming to escape the kitchen by that time I was not impressed what the catering world was offering me.<br>
    <br>
    So I changed fields and ended up in Logistics of all the things. I did that for a total of 6.3 years.<br>
    First as Logistcs Coordinator at a fine art laboratory in Tallinn.<br>
    Managing customers and shipments and the fine art became my everyday. Here my Customer Relation skills skyrocketed. And let me tell you <br>
    artists and art collectors are not easy to handle. By the end I was also juggling Purchaching with my other tasks. <br>
    <br>
    And my second logicstics position was as a Logistics Specialist at Starship Technologies OÃœ, where we shipped and kept track of <br>
    delivery robots all over the world. Main tasks included Inventory Managing, Shipping and again lots of communication with both <br>
    in-house stake holders and outside.<br>
    <br>
    But I wanted to take on coding, and had been for some time already. But since Starship and Vali-IT presented themselves at the same time <br>
    I chose to start with Starship just to have that experience. But after a year and 4 months it was my time to dive into the IT world.<br>
    <br>
    And here I am, trying to keep my nose above the water.<br>
    There are endless amounts to learn, and the fact that I'm missing the fundamentals of IT education puts me somewhat behind the average graduate.<br>
    But I have plenty to bring to the table, least of which is the experience I have acumulated so far in my life and work.<br>

    <h3>The fun me</h3>
    <p> As you might have quessed by the quote at the end of the last topic I am a big fan of sci-fy and fantasy in general.<br>
        Pretty much anything that has the word "Star" in it has my attention - Stargate, Star Wars, Star Trek etc. You can see why I could not <br>
        pass up the opportunity to join with Starship.<br>
        This of course means that I like most "geek" stuff - Dungeons & Dragons, Lego, reading, computer games, board games etc. I must say however, <br>
        I do like to get outside every once in a while. Hiking and grilling and nature are also my kind of things.<br>
        And this pretty much sums me up
